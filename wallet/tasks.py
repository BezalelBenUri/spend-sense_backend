def process_disbursements():
    """
    Celery shared task to process scheduled disbursement plans.

    This task runs periodically to check for active disbursement plans that are due.
    For each due plan, it performs the following actions:
    1. Retrieves the associated user's wallet.
    2. Checks if the wallet's locked balance is sufficient for the disbursement.
    3. Transfers the `amount_per_disbursement` from `locked_balance` to `balance`.
    4. Creates a new `Transaction` record for the disbursement.
    5. Updates the `next_disbursement` date for the plan based on its type (daily/weekly).

    The task logs its execution start time and provides informative messages.
    It's designed to be idempotent for individual plan processing, meaning
    running it multiple times for the same plan within a short window (before
    `next_disbursement` is updated) will not cause duplicate disbursements
    due to the `next_disbursement__lte` filter.
